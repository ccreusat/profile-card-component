## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

First time using Tailwind CSS. Not a big fan. The time I took to learn basic, config file, and write this code. I would have done it in less time with PURE CSS oriented components.

### Continued development

Learn and practice TailwindCSS to see if I find an interest in using it.
